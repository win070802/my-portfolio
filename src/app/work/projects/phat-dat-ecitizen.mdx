## Overview

**PHATDAT eCITIZEN** is an internal mobile application developed for **Phat Dat Group**, designed to digitize internal workflows, enhance inter-department communication, and centralize essential employee services.

The app empowers staff to manage requests, view announcements, and interact with HR and IT systems directly from their mobile devices, improving transparency and efficiency across the organization.

## Key Features

- **Employee Self-Service**: View profile, manage leave requests, access documents, and track assigned tasks.
- **Company Announcements**: Receive important internal news, policy updates, and event notifications.
- **Role-Based Access**: Secure login and permission control tailored to roles such as employee, manager, or admin.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Web-based panel for content management, user roles, and system configurations.
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time alerts and updates via Firebase Cloud Messaging.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building cross-platform mobile applications with native performance.
- **React.js**: For the web-based admin dashboard and internal tools.
- **Node.js**: Backend server for handling business logic, APIs, and authentication.
- **MySQL**: Relational database system for managing data and system records.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: For push notifications and alert delivery.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was coordinating requirements from multiple departments while maintaining a clean, consistent user experience. We addressed this by designing a scalable, modular architecture and implementing role-based interfaces.

Building both the mobile app and admin dashboard in parallel required tight collaboration between frontend and backend teams. Integration testing and feedback loops with actual users helped shape a more intuitive product.

## Outcome

The **eCITIZEN** app has been officially launched on both **Google Play** and the **Apple App Store**, and is actively used by Phat Dat Group employees. It has streamlined internal operations, reduced reliance on manual processes, and laid the foundation for ongoing digital transformation within the organization.
