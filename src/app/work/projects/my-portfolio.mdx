## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website, built to highlight my professional experience, featured projects, and technical capabilities in both mobile and web development. The site also serves as a centralized hub for recruiters, collaborators, and clients to explore my work and connect with me directly.

## Key Features

- **Responsive UI**: Fully responsive layout with smooth transitions and optimized performance across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **SEO-Ready**: Custom meta tags, Open Graph support, and clean HTML structure for enhanced search engine visibility.
- **Project Showcase**: Each project includes summaries, tech stacks, images, and team roles, all dynamically rendered from structured markdown or CMS-like content files.
- **Dark Mode**: Built-in dark/light mode toggle to enhance UX across environments.
- **Minimal, Fast UX**: Pre-rendered pages and optimized images to ensure low loading times and smooth navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Used for server-side rendering, static generation, and routing — providing lightning-fast page loads and SEO benefits.
- **React**: Core framework for building UI components using functional hooks and reusable layouts.
- **CSS Modules & SCSS**: For scoped, maintainable styling and custom design system.
- **Cloudflare**: DNS provider to manage domain and enhance performance through caching and HTTPS.
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform offering CI/CD, preview deployments, and edge delivery for global access.

## Challenges and Learnings

Designing a site that reflects your personality while maintaining performance and code cleanliness is always a balancing act. I experimented with multiple layouts, animation strategies, and content formats before settling on a structure that felt both professional and personal. It also gave me deeper hands-on experience with Next.js Image optimization and Lighthouse performance tweaking.

## Outcome

This portfolio has helped me gain visibility, attract job offers, and provide a polished impression to collaborators and clients. It's also a living project — I actively update it with new work, blog posts, and refinements to better reflect my growth as a developer.
